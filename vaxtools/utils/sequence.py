class Sequence(object):
	"""
	Container for biological (RNA and DNA) sequences.

	::seq:: can be one of three things:
		1) a sequence, as a string
		2) an iterable, formatted as (seq_id, sequence)
		3) a Biopython SeqRecord object

	If ::seq:: is provided as a string, the sequence ID can optionally be
	provided via ::id::.  If ::seq:: is a string and ::id:: is not provided,
	a random sequence ID will be generated with uuid.uuid4().

	Quality scores can be supplied with ::qual:: or as part of the SeqRecord object.
	If providing a SeqRecord object with quality scores and quality scores via ::qual::,
	the ::qual:: scores will override the SeqRecord quality scores.

	A few notes for comparing Sequence objects:
		-- Sequence objects are equal only if their sequences and IDs are identical.
		   This means that two sequences without user-supplied IDs won't be equal,
		   because their IDs will have been randomly generated.
